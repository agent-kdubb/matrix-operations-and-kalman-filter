# Matrix Operations & Kalman Filter Demo

This project is part of my Udacity Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree. It includes:
- A custom matrix class implemented in Python
- A simple Kalman Filter simulation using noisy measurements
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how matrices work and how they're used in robotics

## Files
- `matrix.py`: Core matrix logic
- `datagenerator.py`: Simulates noisy sensor data
- `kalman_filter_demo.ipynb`: Visual demo of a Kalman Filter smoothing position data
- `matrix_playground.ipynb`: Practice matrix operations and transforms

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter Notebook or execute Python files directly

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python OOP
- Matrix manipulation
- Kalman Filtering
